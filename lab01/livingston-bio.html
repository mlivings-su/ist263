    <body>
        My name is Micah Livingston. I am an information management and technology major and I am interested in having a concentration in web design. Before coming to Syracuse, I have had experience in Javascript and Python and I have even formed my own website. Outside of school, I enjoy baking for my family when I get to travel back home to New Jersey. I also like to spend my free time working out, painting, and watching new shows on Netflix.
