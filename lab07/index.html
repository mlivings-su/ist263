        <img src="../images/bio.jpg" alt="Micah">

       <p>My name is <strong>Micah Livingston</strong>. I am 20 years old and I attend Syracuse University.
        I am an information management and technology major and I am interested in having a concentration in web design. 

    <h2> Personal Info</h2>

        <p>  
        Before coming to Syracuse, I have had experience in Javascript and Python and I have even formed my own website. Outside of school, I enjoy baking for my family when I get to travel back home to New Jersey. 
        I also like to spend my free time working out, painting, and watching new shows on Netflix. This year I want to adopt new hobbies for myself to find different ways to spend my time! Here are some of my new hobbies:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Painting</li>
            <li>Traveling</li>
            <li>Shopping</li>
        </ul>
